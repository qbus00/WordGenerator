# WordGenerator/WordSorter

Solution written as a task for interview.

## WordGenerator

This tool is used to generate files according to specification provided in description of task.

External libraries/tools used in project:
1. List of English words (https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) used as a source of words
2. CommandLineParser library (https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline) for parsing and storing command line arguments
3. ShellProgressBar (https://github.com/Mpdreamz/shellprogressbar) to visualize progress of creating file

Description of command line parameters used in the application is available after starting executable without any parameters.

## WordSorter

This is the main tool of this solution. It takes unsorted files (e.g. the ones generated by WordGenerator) and sorts it according to requirements of this task.

As the requirement is to able to handle very large files (e.g. 100GB) application uses K-Way Merge External Sort https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-way_merge_algorithm) algorithm.

Webpages that was a great help when creating this solution:
* https://josef.codes/sorting-really-large-files-with-c-sharp/ - explanation and sample solution with code in C# for K-Way Merge
* https://josef.codes/sorting-large-csv-files-by-column-using-csharp/ - idea how to sort rows by given criteria and how to effectively split strings using memory span to reuse original string when comparing data
* https://mdfarragher.medium.com/c-developers-are-you-tired-of-slow-string-parsing-code-e955b3b3248 - idea how to convert known strings to integers in a very fast way

External libraries/tools used in project:

2. ShellProgressBar (https://github.com/Mpdreamz/shellprogressbar) to visualize progress of sorting
